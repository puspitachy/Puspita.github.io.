Hi! I’m **Puspita Chowdhury**, an MS student in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Yeshiva University** (New York).  
I focus on **AI Ethics**, **low-code analytics**, and building **real-world, human-impact** projects.

### What I’m into
- Ethical AI for healthcare and education  
- Low-code data analysis (Tableau / Power BI / KNIME)  
- Research writing (surveys, frameworks, case studies)

### Selected highlights
- Designed an **AI Ethics framework** for medical imaging (fairness, privacy, transparency, accountability, accessibility).
- Built **low-code dashboards** to quantify study/work loss related to menstrual symptoms.
- Led/mentored student projects and support activities as a **Global Guide @ One-to-World**.

I’m currently seeking **research collaborations** and **AI/Data internships**.  
If my projects resonate, let’s connect!
