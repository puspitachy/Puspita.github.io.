**Idea.** Users set goals, break them into steps, and upload **proof** (files, text).  
An **AI Proof Verifier** (design spec) validates relevance and quality.

**You’ll find**: UX mockups, validation logic rules, and a small demo dataset.  
**Status:** Prototype design ready; implementation planned with **React + Firebase + Flask**.
