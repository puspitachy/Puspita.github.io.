**Goal.** Propose a practical framework to deploy imaging AI responsibly in U.S. healthcare.

**Five pillars.**
1. **Fairness** — performance across sub-populations; bias audits.  
2. **Privacy** — HIPAA-aligned de-identification; secure data handling.  
3. **Transparency** — model cards, data sheets, clinical explainability.  
4. **Accountability** — human-in-the-loop review; incident reporting.  
5. **Accessibility** — low-resource and rural-care considerations.

**Outcome.** A publishable **conceptual framework** (+ checklist) suitable for journals in AI ethics / health informatics.
